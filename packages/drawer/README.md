## Installation

```sh
npm install @vrembem/drawer
```

### Styles

@use "@vrembem/drawer";
```

### JavaScript

```js
import Drawer from '@vrembem/drawer';
const drawer = new Drawer({ autoInit: true });
```

### Markup

Drawers are composed using classes and data attributes for their triggers. The basic structure of a drawer is an element with an `id` and `drawer` class containing a child element with the `drawer__dialog` class. There are two required structure elements for drawers to work correctly:

- `drawer-frame`: Applied to the parent element wrapping all drawers and the main content.
- `drawer-main`: Applied to the element containing the main content. This should be the last child of the `drawer-frame` element.

```html
<div class="drawer-frame">

  <aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer">
    <div class="drawer__dialog">
      ...
    </div>
  </aside>

  <div class="drawer-main">
    ...
  </div>

</div>
```

Drawer triggers are defined using three data attributes:

- `data-drawer-open`: Opens a drawer. Takes the id of the drawer it's meant to open.
- `data-drawer-close`: Closes a drawer. Will close the parent drawer if left value-less. Can also take an id of a drawer to close.
- `data-drawer-toggle`: Toggles a drawer opened or closed. Takes the id of the drawer it's meant to toggle.

```html
<button data-drawer-open="drawer-id">...</button>
<button data-drawer-close="drawer-id">...</button>
<button data-drawer-toggle="drawer-id">...</button>
```

The dialog element of a drawer is defined using the `drawer__dialog` class. Along with a role attribute (e.g. `role="dialog"`), authors should provide drawer dialogs with [`aria-labelledby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) and [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) attributes if applicable to further improve accessibility. The `aria-modal` attribute is applied automatically based on if the drawer is currently in `'modal'` mode.

```html
<aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer">
  <div class="drawer__dialog dialog" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title" aria-describedby="dialog-description">
    <div class="dialog__header">
      <h2 id="dialog-title">...</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="dialog__body">
      <p id="dialog-description">...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialog__footer">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</aside>
```

> The [dialog component](https://github.com/sebnitu/vrembem/tree/main/packages/dialog) is a great fit for composing a drawer's dialog.

#### Modal Drawers

To create a modal drawer, apply the `drawer_modal` modifier.

```html
<aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer drawer_modal">
  ...
</aside>
```

You can also switch a drawer from `'inline'` to `'modal'` by changing the collection API `mode` property:

```js
// Get the drawer object from the collection.
const entry = drawer.get('drawer-id');

// Set it's mode to either 'modal' or 'inline'.
entry.mode = 'modal';
```

In cases where you'd like a drawer to switch modes based on a specific viewport width, use the `data-drawer-breakpoint` data attribute with either a width value or a breakpoint key.

```html
<!-- Switches to modal below 1200px viewports -->
<aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer" data-drawer-breakpoint="1200px">
  ...
</aside>

<!-- Switches to modal below "md" breakpoint viewports -->
<aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer" data-drawer-breakpoint="md">
  ...
</aside>
```

A custom breakpoints object can be passed in using the `breakpoints` option. Otherwise, breakpoints are resolved by looking up a CSS variable using the passed key (e.g: `--vb-breakpoint-[key]`).

```js
const drawer = new Drawer({
  breakpoints: {
    xs: '480px',
    sm: '620px',
    md: '760px',
    lg: '990px',
    xl: '1380px'
  }
});
```

```scss
:root {
  --vb-breakpoint-xs: 480px;
  --vb-breakpoint-sm: 620px;
  --vb-breakpoint-md: 760px;
  --vb-breakpoint-lg: 990px;
  --vb-breakpoint-xl: 1380px;
}
```

While a modal drawer is active, the contents obscured by the modal are made inaccessible to all users via a focus trap. This means that the `TAB` key, and a screen readerâ€™s virtual cursor (arrow keys) should not be allowed to leave the drawer dialog and traverse the content outside of the dialog. This does not apply to inline drawers.

#### Focus Management

Drawer dialogs are given focus when opened as long as the `setTabindex` option is set to `true` or if the drawer dialog has `tabindex="-1"` set manually. If focus on a specific element inside a drawer is preferred, give that element the `data-focus` attribute. Focus is returned to the element that initially triggered the drawer once closed.

```html
<div class="drawer-frame">
  <!-- Focuses the drawer dialog on open -->
  <aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer">
    <div class="drawer__dialog" tabindex="-1">
      ...
    </div>
  </aside>

  <!-- Focuses an inner element on open -->
  <aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer">
    <div class="drawer__dialog">
      <input data-focus type="text">
      ...
    </div>
  </aside>
  
  <div class="drawer-main">
    <!-- Return focus to toggle on close -->
    <button data-drawer-toggle="drawer-id">...</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

> To change the selector used in finding the preferred focus element, pass your own selector via the `selectorFocus` option (defaults to `'[data-focus]'`).

#### Drawer State

The state of all drawers are saved to local storage and applied persistently under the `VB:DrawerState` local storage key. Set `store: false` to disable the local storage feature. Use `storeKey: "CUSTOM-KEY"` to change the key that local store is saved under.

## Behavior and Accessibility

Drawers while in their modal state follow a set of patterns expected from other modals on the web. Here's what to expect:

1. When a modal drawer is opened, focus is moved to the dialog or an element inside.
2. Modal drawers provide standard methods for the user to close such as using the `esc` key or clicking outside the dialog.
3. While the modal drawer is active, contents obscured by the modal are inaccessible to all users.
4. When a modal drawer is closed, focus is returned to the initial trigger element that activated the dialog.

To take full advantage of modal drawer's accessibility features, it's recommended to set the `selectorInert` option to all elements that are outside the modal (most likely the `drawer-main` element). All elements that match the `selectorInert` selector will be given the `inert` attribute as well as `aria-hidden="true"` when a modal is opened.

### Example

Here's an example where we want the `drawer-main` content area to be inaccessible while drawer modals are open. We also want to disable other scrollable elements using the `selectorOverflow` option.

```js
const drawer = new Drawer({
  selectorInert: '.drawer-main',
  selectorOverflow: 'body, .drawer-main'
});

await drawer.init();
```

## Modifiers

### `drawer_modal`

Applies modal drawer styles to a drawer. To convert a drawer to its modal state after its been registered, set the collection API `mode` property to `'modal'`. Only one modal can be open at a time.

```html
<aside id="drawer-id" class="drawer drawer_modal">
  ...
</aside>
```

### `drawer_switch`

Drawers slide in from the left by default. To create a right side drawer, use the `drawer_switch` modifier.

```html
<aside id="drawer-right" class="drawer drawer_switch">
  ...
</aside>
```

## API

### `drawer.collection`

Returns an array where all drawer objects are stored when registered. Each drawer object contains the following properties:

```js
{
  id: String, // The unique ID of the drawer.
  state: String, // The current state of the drawer ('closing', 'closed', 'opening' or 'opened').
  el: HTMLElement, // The drawer HTML element.
  dialog: HTMLElement // The drawer dialog HTML element.
  trigger: HTMLElement // The trigger element that opened the drawer.
  settings: Object // The drawer specific settings.
  breakpoint: String // Returns the set breakpoint of the drawer. If no breakpoint is set, returns 'null'.
  mode: String // The current mode of the drawer. Either 'inline' or 'modal'.
  open: Function // Method to open this drawer.
  close: Function // Method to close this drawer.
  toggle: Function // Method to toggle this drawer opened and closed.
  deregister: Function // Method to deregister this drawer.
  mountBreakpoint: Function // Method to mount the breakpoint feature.
  unmountBreakpoint: Function // Method to unmount the breakpoint feature.
  handleBreakpoint: Function // The function that runs whenever the breakpoint media match property is changed. Receives the event parameter.
  getSetting: Function // Method that returns either a drawer specific setting or global drawer setting.
}
```

**Returns**

- `Array` An array of collection entries.

### `drawer.activeModal`

Returns the currently active modal drawer. Returns `undefined` if there is no modal drawer open.

**Returns**

- `Object || undefined` Collection entry.

### `drawer.init(options)`

Initializes the drawer instance. During initialization, the following processes are run:

- Register each drawer in the collection by running `registerCollection()`.
- Sets up global event listeners by running `initEventListeners()`.

**Parameters**

- `options [Object] (optional)` An options object for passing custom settings.

```js
const drawer = new Drawer();
await drawer.init();
