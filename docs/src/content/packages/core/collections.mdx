Collections are used to create the scaffolding and shared systems that all Vrembem JavaScript components inherit. These systems include configuration, events, lifecycle hooks, and plugins.

<CodeExample lang="js">
```js
import { Collection, CollectionEntry } from "@vrembem/core";
```
</CodeExample>

## Basic usage

The best way to understand collections and the systems they offer is to create a component and use them directly. In this documentation, we'll create a simple component and explore how collections work in practice.

<CodeExample lang="js">
```js
import { Collection } from "@vrembem/core";

export class Box extends Collection {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
    this.module = "Box";
  }
}
```
</CodeExample>
