The `core` package provides a number of pre-defined CSS variables that are used throughout the Vrembem library.

## Output

CSS variables are not automatically output when `@vrembem/core` is imported or used. To output core CSS varibales, use the `@vrembem/core/root` export at the bottom of your Sass manifest file.

<CodeExample lang="scss">
```scss
@forward "@vrembem/core/root";
```
</CodeExample>

Alternatively, custom properties can also be output manually using the `core/css` and `core/theme` modules:

<CodeExample lang="scss">
```scss
@use "@vrembem/core/css";
@use "@vrembem/core/theme";

// Output all registered CSS variables
:root {
  @include css.output;
}

// Output all registered theme CSS variables
@include theme.output;
```
</CodeExample>

It is recommended to output CSS variables at the end of your Sass manifest file. This is to ensure that all uses of registered properties are included in the output.

## Reference

Below is a reference to all CSS variables and their values. Theme variables will use the value based on the current theme as shown by the sun (<Icon name="sun" classes="icon_inline icon_size_sm" />) and moon (<Icon name="moon" classes="icon_inline icon_size_sm" />) icons.

<ReferenceTable id="cssvar-core" data={data} keyWidth="45%" />
