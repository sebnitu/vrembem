# Table

A table component for displaying HTML tables.

```sh
npm install @vrembem/table
```

<CodeExample lang="scss">
  ```scss
  @use "@vrembem/table";
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Basic usage

For basic table styles, only the `table` component class is required. Use [proper HTML table markup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) and styles should apply as expected.

<CodeExample lang="html">
  <Fragment slot="output">
    <table class="table">
      <caption>List of my favorite anarchists.</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>#</th>
          <th>First</th>
          <th>Last</th>
          <th>Email</th>
          <th>Handle</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>1</th>
          <td>Noam</td>
          <td>Chomsky</td>
          <td>noam@gmail.com</td>
          <td>@chomsky</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>2</th>
          <td>Howard</td>
          <td>Zinn</td>
          <td>hzinn@gmail.com</td>
          <td>@zinn</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>3</th>
          <td>PJ</td>
          <td>Proudhon</td>
          <td>pj@proudhon.com</td>
          <td>@pjproudhon</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>3</th>
          <td>Rudolf</td>
          <td>Rocker</td>
          <td>rudolf@rocker.com</td>
          <td>@rrocker</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </Fragment>
  ```html
  <table class="table">
    <caption>List of my favorite anarchists.</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>#</th>
        <th>First</th>
        <th>Last</th>
        <th>Email</th>
        <th>Handle</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Noam</td>
        <td>Chomsky</td>
        <td>noam@gmail.com</td>
        <td>@chomsky</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Howard</td>
        <td>Zinn</td>
        <td>hzinn@gmail.com</td>
        <td>@zinn</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>PJ</td>
        <td>Proudhon</td>
        <td>pj@proudhon.com</td>
        <td>@pjproudhon</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Rudolf</td>
        <td>Rocker</td>
        <td>rudolf@rocker.com</td>
        <td>@rrocker</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  ```
</CodeExample>

For simple responsive table styles, wrap your tables in the [`scroll-box` base module](/packages/base#scroll-box) which provides horizontal scrolling when tables can't fit in their container.

<CodeExample lang="html">
  <Fragment slot="output">
    <div class="scroll-box">
      <table class="table" style="width: 64rem">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Book</th>
            <th>Pages</th>
            <th>Quote</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-nowrap">The Hobbit</td>
            <td>272</td>
            <td>"Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-nowrap">The Fellowship of the Ring</td>
            <td>377</td>
            <td>"I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo. "So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-nowrap">The Two Towers</td>
            <td>322</td>
            <td>"War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend."</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-nowrap">The Return of the King</td>
            <td>277</td>
            <td>"But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them."</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  </Fragment>
  ```html
  <div class="scroll-box">
    <table class="table">
      ...
    </table>
  </div>
  ```
</CodeExample>

## table_ellipsis

Switches a table layout to `fixed` and adds ellipsis overflow styles to table cells and headers.

```html
<table class="table table_ellipsis">
  ...
</table>
```

Space will be split equally between columns when `table_ellipsis` is applied. For more control over specific column widths, use the `<colgroup>` and `<col>` elements and set their desired widths as needed.

```html
<table class="table table_ellipsis">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50px;">
  </colgroup>
  ...
</table>
```

## table_hover

Adds hover and focus state styles for table row (`<tr>`) elements.

```html
<table class="table table_hover">
  ...
</table>
```

## table_responsive_[key]

When the [`scroll-box` base module](https://github.com/sebnitu/vrembem/tree/main/packages/base#scroll-box) isn't mobile friendly enough, this modifier adds responsive styles to a table so that it's easier to read on specific breakpoints. This is done by using the `data-mobile-label` attribute on table cells that should correspond to the table column header for that specific cell. Use the value-less `table_responsive` modifier to apply these styles universally.

```html
<table class="table table_responsive_lg">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td data-mobile-label="key">...</td>
      <td data-mobile-label="value">...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

The mobile label value will be truncated if it exceeds the width set by `$mobile-label-width`, so keep the label terse when possible.

**Available Variants**

- `table_responsive`
- `table_responsive_xs`
- `table_responsive_sm`
- `table_responsive_md`
- `table_responsive_lg`
- `table_responsive_xl`

### `@mixin table-responsive-styles()`

Output responsive table styles. This is used to generate the styles for the `table_responsive_[key]` modifier.

**Example**

```scss
.table_custom_modifier {
  @include table-responsive-styles();
}
```

## table_size_[value]

Adjust the size of a table by increasing or decreasing cell padding.

```html
<table class="table table_size_sm">
  ...`
</table>
```

**Available Variants**

- `table_size_sm`
- `table_size_lg`

## table_style_[value]

Adds table styles based on the provided value.

```html
<table class="table table_style_rowed">
  ...
</table>
```

**Available Variants**

- `table_style_rowed`
- `table_style_bordered`

## table_zebra

Adds zebra styled rows to a table to help increase its readability. This is done by alternating the background color of rows to help guide the reader's eye.

```html
<table class="table table_zebra">
  ...
</table>
```

## Customization
