## Basic usage

Vrembem's core package is the common denominator for all components. Its main purpose is to set the base systems that all other components are built upon. Core also provides useful one-off mixins, functions, and styles that can be applied as needed.

Sass modules and their purpose:

- [core.config](/packages/core/config): This module is used to setup the global configuration object. This is used across all components to set things like prefixes, BEM naming syntax and default themes.
- [core.usage](/packages/core/usage): Used to enable features such as output-strategy and provides usage information for CSS variables.
- [core.css](/packages/core/css): This module manages CSS custom properties (variables) by providing tools such as set, get, and output for properties defined under a component name.
- [core.palette](/packages/core/palette): Defines the design system's color palette. This takes in a map of key and color seed values and builds a variety of usable color values for your project.
- [core.theme](/packages/core/theme): Themes are how and where the design system's palette are applied. It also manages a projects light and dark mode color values.
