# Core

Vrembem's core package provides a number of Sass and JavaScript modules that make up the shared systems, configurations, and utilities of the Vrembem library.

```sh
npm install @vrembem/core
```

<CodeExample lang="scss">
  ```scss
  @use "@vrembem/core";
  ```
</CodeExample>

<CodeExample lang="js">
  ```js
  import * as core from "@vrembem/core";
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Sass modules

Vrembem uses Sass modules to manage global configuration and custom properties throughout the library.

- [`@vrembem/core/config`](/packages/core/config): Used to setup global configuration options. This is available across all components to set things like BEM naming syntax, prefixes, and theme defaults.
- [`@vrembem/core/css`](/packages/core/css): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/palette`](/packages/core/palette): Used to define, manage, and output a color palette powered by custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/theme`](/packages/core/theme): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level themes powered by custom properties.

### Theme state

After defining themes using Vrembem's core theme module, users should be able to select their preferred theme and have that choice persist. Vrembem provides `themeStore`, a JavaScript utility that manages theme state for your application or website.

## Collections

Collection and CollectionEntry are base classes designed to manage component instances—such as modals, drawers, or popovers. Each Collection acts as a controller, handling registration, events, lifecycle hooks, and plugin integration.

CollectionEntry represent an individual component instance within a collection, storing its state, configuration, and DOM reference. By extending these classes, Vrembem components inherit shared systems and APIs that can also be leveraged by custom components or plugins.

### Plugins

Vrembem provides plugins designed to extend the features of components managed by collections, adding advanced behaviors and integrations to your JavaScript components.

- [`attrConfig`](/packages/core/attr-config): Adds the ability to set a configuration source using the value of a data attribute.
- [`cssConfig`](/packages/core/css-config): Adds the ability to set a configuration source using the values of CSS custom properties.
- [`focusTrap`](/packages/core/focus-trap): Ensures keyboard focus remains within a specified element, such as a modal or dialog, while it is open. This improves accessibility by preventing users from tabbing outside interactive overlays.
- [`mediaQuery`](/packages/core/media-query): Provides a flexible API for managing responsive behaviors and breakpoints using custom data attributes and media queries. It enables components to react to viewport changes and device characteristics.
- [`propStore`](/packages/core/prop-store): Synchronizes component state with local storage, allowing values to persist across page reloads and sessions. It supports conditional storage and change callbacks for advanced state management.
- [`teleport`](/packages/core/teleport): Moves DOM elements to different locations in the document, such as rendering modals or tooltips outside their parent containers. This helps manage stacking contexts and ensures overlays display correctly.

It's also possible to write your own custom plugins. Custom plugins allow you to extend collections with specialized logic, event handling, or integrations tailored to your specific requirements.

## Reference

Outside of core systems, Vrembem also makes available a number of variables, functions and mixins that can be used throughout your project as needed.

### CSS Variables

Vrembem core defines a set of global variables via CSS custom properties that are accessible to all components and help establish a consistent design language across your project. These are stored under the `core` module and are not prefixed with the module name when output.

[Custom properties reference](/packages/core/css-variables)

### Sass Utilities

Vrembem core provides a number of helpful Sass functions and mixin utilities. Some of which are used internally by components to apply consistent design patterns (such as focus rings) and others are helpful stand-off utilities like drawing CSS arrows or loading spinners.
