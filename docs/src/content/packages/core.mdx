# Core

Provides the base systems and utilities that all Vrembem components are built upon.

```sh
npm install @vrembem/core
```

<CodeExample lang="scss">
  ```scss
  @use "@vrembem/core";
  ```
</CodeExample>

<CodeExample lang="js">
  ```js
  import * as core from "@vrembem/core";
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Basic usage

Vrembem's core package is the common denominator for all components. Its main purpose is to set the base systems that all other components are built upon. Core also provides useful one-off mixins, functions, and styles that can be applied as needed.

### Sass modules

Vrembem uses Sass modules to manage global configuration and custom properties throughout the library.

- [`@vrembem/core/config`](/packages/core/config): Used to setup global configuration options. This is available across all components to set things like BEM naming syntax, prefixes, and theme defaults.
- [`@vrembem/core/css`](/packages/core/css): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/palette`](/packages/core/palette): Used to define, manage, and output a color palette powered by custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/theme`](/packages/core/theme): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level themes powered by custom properties.

### Theme state

After defining themes using Vrembem's core theme module, users should be able to select their preferred theme and have that choice persist. Vrembem provides `themeStore`, a JavaScript utility that manages theme state for your application or website.

## Collections

Collection and CollectionEntry are base classes designed to manage groups of related component instances, such as modals, drawers, or popovers. Each Collection acts as a controller, handling registration, lifecycle events, and plugin integration for its entries.

Collection Entries represent individual components within a collection, storing their state, configuration, and DOM references. By extending these classes, Vrembem components gain a unified API for initialization, event handling, and dynamic behavior.

### Plugins

Vrembem provides plugins designed to extend the features of components managed by collections, adding advanced behaviors and integrations to your JavaScript components.

- [`focusTrap`](/packages/core/focusTrap): Ensures keyboard focus remains within a specified element, such as a modal or dialog, while it is open. This improves accessibility by preventing users from tabbing outside interactive overlays.
- [`mediaQuery`](/packages/core/mediaQuery): Provides a flexible API for managing responsive behaviors and breakpoints using custom data attributes and media queries. It enables components to react to viewport changes and device characteristics.
- [`propStore`](/packages/core/propStore): Synchronizes component state with local storage, allowing values to persist across page reloads and sessions. It supports conditional storage and change callbacks for advanced state management.
- [`teleport`](/packages/core/teleport): Moves DOM elements to different locations in the document, such as rendering modals or tooltips outside their parent containers. This helps manage stacking contexts and ensures overlays display correctly.

## Reference

Outside of core systems, Vrembem also makes available a number of variables, functions and mixins that can be used throughout your project as needed.

### Variables

Vrembem core defines a set of global variables via CSS custom properties that are accessible to all components, helping establish a consistent design language across your project. These are stored under the `core` module and are not prefixed with the module name when output.

### Utilities

Vrembem core provides a number of helpful Sass functions and mixin utilities. Some of which are used internally by components to apply consistent design patterns (such as focus rings) and others are helpful stand-off utilities like drawing CSS arrows or loading spinners.
