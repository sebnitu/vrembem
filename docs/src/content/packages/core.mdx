# Core

Shared variables, functions and mixins for Vrembem components.

```sh
npm install @vrembem/core
```

<CodeExample lang="scss">
  ```scss
  @use "@vrembem/core";
  ```
</CodeExample>

<CodeExample lang="js">
  ```js
  import * as core from "@vrembem/core";
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Basic usage

Vrembem's core package is the common denominator for all components. Its main purpose is to set the base systems that all other components are built upon. Core also provides useful one-off mixins, functions, and styles that can be applied as needed.

### Sass modules

Vrembem uses Sass modules to manage global configuration and custom properties throughout the library.

- [`@vrembem/core/config`](/packages/core/config): Used to setup global configuration options. This is available across all components to set things like prefixes, BEM naming syntax and default themes.
- [`@vrembem/core/css`](/packages/core/css): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/palette`](/packages/core/palette): Used to define, manage, and output a color palette powered by custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/theme`](/packages/core/theme): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level themes powered by custom properties.

### Plugins

Vrembem offers optional plugins to extend and add features to its JavaScript components.

- [`focusTrap`](/packages/core/focusTrap): Ensures keyboard focus remains within a specified element, such as a modal or dialog, while it is open. This improves accessibility by preventing users from tabbing outside interactive overlays.
- [`mediaQuery`](/packages/core/mediaQuery): Provides a flexible API for managing responsive behaviors and breakpoints using custom data attributes and media queries. It enables components to react to viewport changes and device characteristics.
- [`propStore`](/packages/core/propStore): Synchronizes component state with local storage, allowing values to persist across page reloads and sessions. It supports conditional storage and change callbacks for advanced state management.
- [`teleport`](/packages/core/teleport): Moves DOM elements to different locations in the document, such as rendering modals or tooltips outside their parent containers. This helps manage stacking contexts and ensures overlays display correctly.
