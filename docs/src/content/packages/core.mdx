## Basic usage

Vrembem's core package is the common denominator for all components. Its main purpose is to set the base systems that all other components are built upon. Core also provides useful one-off mixins, functions, and styles that can be applied as needed.

### Sass modules

- [`@vrembem/core/config`](/packages/core/config): This module is used to setup the global configuration options. This is used across all components to set things like prefixes, BEM naming syntax and default themes.
- [`@vrembem/core/css`](/packages/core/css): A core Sass module for managing global and component custom properties. This is done by creating CSS custom properties that can be referenced and output to the stylesheet.
- [`@vrembem/core/palette`](/packages/core/palette): Defines the design system's color palette. This takes in a map of key and color seed values and builds a variety of usable color values for your project.
- [`@vrembem/core/theme`](/packages/core/theme): Themes are how and where the design system's palette are applied. It also manages a projects light and dark mode color values.
