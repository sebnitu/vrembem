Shared variables, functions and mixins for Vrembem components.

<CodeExample lang="scss">

## Basic usage

Vrembem's core package is the common denominator for all components. Its main purpose is to set the base systems that all other components are built upon. Core also provides useful one-off mixins, functions, and styles that can be applied as needed.

### Sass modules

- [`@vrembem/core/config`](/packages/core/config): Used to setup global configuration options. This is available across all components to set things like prefixes, BEM naming syntax and default themes.
- [`@vrembem/core/css`](/packages/core/css): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/palette`](/packages/core/palette): Used to define, manage, and output a color palette powered by custom properties.
- [`@vrembem/core/theme`](/packages/core/theme): Used to define, manage, and output global and component-level themes powered by custom properties.
