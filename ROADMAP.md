## Components

This is a table of all available components along with their status.

__Labels:__

- ‚úÖ __Stable__ - A fully tested and developed component. Likely won't have breaking changes.
- ü§î __Audit__ - Needs further review.
- ‚úèÔ∏è __Refactor__ - Worth keeping, but needs to be re-written. High likelyhood for breaking changes.
- ‚Ü™Ô∏è __Merge__ - Possibly merge with an existing component or rolled into `base`/`utility` packages.
- ‚úÇÔ∏è __Deprecate__ - Doesn't see much use. High chance of being deprecated.

| #   | Component      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                           | Status |
| --- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | `arrow`        | Maybe move into `core` mixins and class output in `utility`?                                                                                                                                    | ‚Ü™Ô∏è      |
| 2   | `base`         | Very stable with strong existing patterns. Can only grow.                                                                                                                                       | ‚úÖ      |
| 3   | `breadcrumb`   | This is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                   | ‚úÖ      |
| 4   | `button`       | The staple of any component library.                                                                                                                                                            | ‚úÖ      |
| 5   | `button-group` | This feels very similar to `level`, maybe merge? Are these specific usecases that can't be covered by `level`?                                                                                  | ü§î      |
| 6   | `card`         | Extremely versatile container component.                                                                                                                                                        | ‚úÖ      |
| 7   | `checkbox`     | Staple form control.                                                                                                                                                                            | ‚úÖ      |
| 8   | `container`    | This could be handled by `utility` with the introduction of a `max-width` utility.                                                                                                              | ‚Ü™Ô∏è      |
| 9   | `core`         | Very well established root variables, mixins and functions. Can only grow.                                                                                                                      | ‚úÖ      |
| 10  | `dialog`       | Similar to `card`, extremely versatile container component. Used in both `drawer` and `modal` for composition.                                                                                  | ‚úÖ      |
| 11  | `drawer`       | Super stable component and pattern. maybe audit the need for `drawer__wrapper` and `drawer__main` since they're the only component elements that sit outside the base `drawer` component class. | ‚úÖ      |
| 12  | `dropdown`     | This‚Äîalong with `tooltip`‚Äîcould be merged into a more generic component. Maybe `popover`?                                                                                                       | ‚Ü™Ô∏è      |
| 13  | `grid`         | Well established pattern. Won't change much.                                                                                                                                                    | ‚úÖ      |
| 14  | `icon`         | I like the idea of having an `icon` component. Should audit the existing modifiers though.                                                                                                      | ü§î      |
| 15  | `icon-action`  | Maybe merge this into a `button` modifier.                                                                                                                                                      | ‚Ü™Ô∏è      |
| 16  | `input`        | Staple form control.                                                                                                                                                                            | ‚úÖ      |
| 17  | `level`        | Base styles are well done and very stable. Worth exploring modifier changes for inclusion of `button-group` component.                                                                          | ‚úÖ      |
| 18  | `media`        | Super versatile layout component.                                                                                                                                                               | ‚úÖ      |
| 19  | `menu`         | Super versatile component with well established patterns. Won't change much.                                                                                                                    | ‚úÖ      |
| 20  | `modal`        | Super stable component and pattern.                                                                                                                                                             | ‚úÖ      |
| 21  | `notice`       | A staple component. Currently not a fan of the need for `notice__body`, should be reconsidered.                                                                                                 | ‚úèÔ∏è      |
| 22  | `panel`        | This is too generic.                                                                                                                                                                            | ‚úÇÔ∏è      |
| 23  | `radio`        | Staple form control.                                                                                                                                                                            | ‚úÖ      |
| 24  | `section`      | There is a need for `__background` and `__screen` elements within a container, not sure if this fills that need. `card` uses similar styles.                                                    | ü§î      |
| 25  | `switch`       | Staple form control.                                                                                                                                                                            | ‚úÖ      |
| 26  | `table`        | Table styles are important.                                                                                                                                                                     | ‚úÖ      |
| 27  | `tooltip`      | This‚Äîalong with `dropdown`‚Äîcould be merged into a more generic component. Maybe `popover`?                                                                                                      | ‚Ü™Ô∏è      |
| 28  | `utility`      | Very stable with strong existing patterns. Can only grow.                                                                                                                                       | ‚úÖ      |
